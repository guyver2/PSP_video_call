# Video Call on the PSP

## What is this?
A pair of prototype applications (client and server) to stream the video taken by a PSP equiped with a Chotto Shot camera to another PSP over the internet.

## Did it work?
Kinda. It was capable of streaming an 8bit 120x68px RGBA image at roughly 5FPS over the internet.
